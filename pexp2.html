    <h1>SIMULATION OF PNEUMATIC LOGIC CIRCUITS</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Aim:</h2><h3>To design a pneumatic circuit for “AND” gate logic unit using two pressure valve for single acting cylinder. 
    </h3>
    <h2>APPARATUS REQUIRED:</h2><h3>AND Gate, Double acting cylinder, 5/2 pilot operated spring return dcv 3/2 push button </h3>

    <h2>Procedure:</h2><h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure sufficient air pressure is available as input in the FRL unit. The connections are made as per the circuit diagram .The inlet port 1 of the 5/2 DCV</li>
            <li>The inlet port 1 of the 5/2 DCV (1) and 3/2 push button (2) is connected from the FRL unit.</li>
            <li>The outlet port 2 of the 5/2 DCV (1) and 3/2 push button (2) is connected to the two AND Gate AND Gate port is connected to pilot operated 5/2 DCV 5/2 DCV port is connected to blank end of double acting cylinder. </li>
            <li>The forward stroke occurs during the following condition.</li>
