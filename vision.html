   <h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Good lab facilities and updated lab experiments are critical for any engineering college. Paucity of lab facilities often make it difficult to conduct experiments. Also, good teachers are always a scarce resource. The Virtual Labs project addresses this issue of lack of good lab facilities, as well as trained teachers, by providing remote-access to simulation-based Labs in various disciplines of science and engineering. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Yet another objective is to arouse the curiosity of the students and permit them to learn at their own pace. This student-centric approach facilitates the absorption of basic and advanced concepts through simulation-based experimentation.
            Virtual labs are any place, any pace, any-time, any-type labs. It is a paradigm shift in student-centric, online education.
